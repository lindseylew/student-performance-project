# Student Performance Analysis Project

---

## 🚀 Live Demo

🔗 **Streamlit App:** [Launch the Live App](https://student-performance-project-a5egfhkburekappx72h2rkn.streamlit.app/)
This interactive demo allows users to explore how study habits and engagement relate to predicted academic outcomes using a Random Forest model.

---

This project explores how student habits, engagement, and access factors relate to academic outcomes.
Using a dataset of **14,003 anonymized student records**, the goal is to understand:

- Which behaviors correlate most with strong academic performance
- How behavioral patterns group students into learning profiles
- Whether we can **predict FinalGrade categories** using machine learning

---

## Project Highlights
- Data cleaned and processed using reproducable steps
- **8 student behavior clusters** discovered using K-Means
- Model improved from **29% to 90% accuracy** through feature engineering
- Key drivers of performance identified
    - Study efficiency
    - Attendance consistency
    - Engagement behaviors
- **Interactive Streamlit app** built to demonstrate real-time predictions

---

## Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Exploration
    - Identified key behavioral and contextual variables
    - Analyzed relationships between behavior and FinalGrade
    - Compared numeric patterns and categorical patterns

### 2️⃣ Behavioal Clustering
    - Applied **K-Means clustering**
    - Identified distinct student learning profiles
    - Compared motivation, resources, and engagement across clusters

### 3️⃣ Predictive Modeling
    - Baseline **Logistic Regression** (~20% accuracy)
    - **Random Forest Classifier** (~90% accuracy)
    - Evaluated using:
        - Classification report
        - Confusion matrix
        - Class-level performance metrics

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering
Created new variables that significantly improved performance:

- `StudyEfficiency`
- `AttendanceRatio`
- `TechAccess`
- `EngagementScore`
- `StressBalance`

Feature engineering logic is shared across noteboods and the Streamlit app for consistency

## Interactive Streamlit App

The project includes a Streamlit application that allows users to:

- Adjusts student behavior inputs
- Generate real-time grade predictions
- View class probabilities and confidence
- Inspect engineered features used by the model

> ⚠️ This app is for **educational demonstration only** and odes not make real academic decisions.
